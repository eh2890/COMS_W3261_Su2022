# Homework Templates

Start new homework assignments using:
```
$ ./start_hw.sh <hw number>
```
where `<hw number>` is the homework number you are working on (e.g. for "HW4", `<hw number>` would be `4`).

This will generate a directory named `HW<hw number>/` (e.g. for "HW4", the directory will be `HW4/`), which will contain the file `HW<hw number>.tex`, which in turn contains a minimal template for you to start working from.
